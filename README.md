Capturer - imbecile video to file capture
SharpStresser - run video streams images on object detection graph with multi gpu, expose results of detection on web service endpoint
 Detection Results Endpoint: http://localhost:5000/TensorProcessor
Visualizer - visualize object detection on video stream
 use:
 * video with fake boxes: https://localhost:6001/fake/rtsp%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.1%2F , https://localhost:6001/fake/file%3A%2F%2F%2FC%3A%2Ftest.mp4
